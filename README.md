# TorrentDog

TorrentDog is a smart, loyal and secure docker cluster that routes all torrent through Wireguard via NordVPN while providing a user interferace for Transmission, Radarr and Sonarr.

It's like having a loyal friend who fetches all your mail (media) for you but growls at the nosey mailman (governments/corporations) when he steps on your lawn.
